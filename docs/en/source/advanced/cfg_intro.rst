Configuration
##########################################


Overview
======================

In order to allow players to further understand the realization of the game mechanism, we have opened some parameters for players to adjust. We hope that players can modify the corresponding parameters to achieve a variety of different environments. At the same time, you can also design your own agent environment to quickly verify the algorithm.

GoBigger puts configurable parameters in ``gobigger/server/server_default_config.py``
